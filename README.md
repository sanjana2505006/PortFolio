A few months ago, I found myself deeply moved by a book—one that made me cry, feel angry, and even experience a surge of joy, all within a few pages. It wasn’t just a story; it was a journey that I could feel in my core. At that moment, I realized how much I truly love reading.

This experience was a turning point for me. As a CSE student, I had always been immersed in the world of technology, but that book reminded me of the emotional intelligence and creativity required in both storytelling and tech. The ability to understand different perspectives, to feel deeply, and to think critically—these skills are as essential in programming as they are in understanding people.

That day, I walked into a book market and left with a stack of novels, eager to dive deeper into the worlds they offer. Reading, I realized, wasn’t just a hobby; it was a tool for growth—both personally and professionally.

It got me thinking: how do we nurture creativity and innovation in our lives, whether through stories, technology, or other practices?
